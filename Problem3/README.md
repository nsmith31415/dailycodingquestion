Given a dictionary of words, and a string made up of those words (no spcaes), return the original sentence in a list. If there is more than one reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return null.

For example, given the set of words `quick`, `brown`, `the`, `fox`, and the string `thequickbrownfox`, you should return `['the','quick','brown','fox']`
