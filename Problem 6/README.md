Make a function that checks if a maze inputted as a 2d of 1s and 0s has an exit. 

The maze will be a 2d array where a `0` represents a path and a `1` represents a wall. You will start in the upper-left of the maze and you will be trying to traverse to the bottom-right of the maze. (Coordinates [0,0] to [3,3])
Below is an example of a maze that has a valid path from entrance to exit:
```
    {0, 1, 0, 0}
    {0, 0, 0, 1}
    {1, 0, 0, 1}
    {0, 0, 1, 0}
```
